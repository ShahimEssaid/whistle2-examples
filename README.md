# Introduction

This repository is meant to develop and apply Whistle2 mapping examples. It contains a custom Whistle2 distribution under the `/whistle2-engine`, example inputs under `/inputs`, a set of Whistle2 mappings under `/mappings`, and BASH scripts under `/examples` to run specific examples.  See the READMEs in those specific directories for additional details.

A few examples are to demonstrate Whistle2 abilities but others are useful work that you might be able to reuse in your own projects.  Look for README files in the relevant directories to learn more about the current examples.


# Whistle2

The Whistle2 language and implementation is provided by Google at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare-data-harmonization/tree/master). Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare-data-harmonization/tree/master/doc). This project is also providing mappings for specific use cases as can be seen [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare-data-harmonization/tree/master/mappings).

# Whistle2 in this repository

The Whistle2 distribution that is included in this repository under the `/whistle2-engine` directory is based on my own custom build of the upstream code. See [here](https://github.com/ShahimEssaid/healthcare-data-harmonization/tree/master-se/se-builds).  The distribution also includes additional implementation features based on work done [here](https://github.com/ShahimEssaid/whistle2-impl).
